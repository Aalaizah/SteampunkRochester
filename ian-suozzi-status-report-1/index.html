            <p>It has been eight weeks since this class has started and everyone began working on this "Steampunk Rochester" game. I have been assigned to the writing team for this project, which seems to be a good fit for me. So far, we've managed to create a basic foundation for the story, including a general summary, a list of the main characters and their major traits, and multiple possible endings for where we can focus on what direction to guide the plot to to our final destination.</p>

<p>Admittedly, it seems a little barren after eight weeks, but I suppose that could be attributed to the fact that there are only three of us on the writing staff. Still though, the fact that we don't even have names for any of the characters besides "Sophie" troubles me a bit. That name didn't even come from any of us, but someone from the design team instead. Then again, I could be simply overestimating how much we could get done in this amount of time. And even though it wasn't the writing team who came up with our only named character, we are very much grateful for any and all outside help and suggestions from the other teams.</p>

<p>We are about to start writing dialogue soon, so hopefully progress will pick up soon. It seems to be a specialty of mine when it comes to my stories, so maybe I'll be able to contribute a great amount for this portion. We're also going to focus on how certain dialogue choices and actions will affect the outcome of the plot, so be sure to look forward to that.</p>
