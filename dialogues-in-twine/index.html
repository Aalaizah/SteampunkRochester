        <section class="post-content">
            <p>Last week, we started writing our dialogue. I was really excited to be using Twine for a project since I find it very fun to play with the structure of stories in it. Programming team had some formatting requirements for their <strong>Twine to Unity</strong> program, but adding those on top of Twine's formatting wasn't too difficult.</p>

<p>There were some communication errors initially. Programming team didn't understand how Twine's choice system worked <em>([[This is link test AND the passage to link to]], [[This is link text|This is the Passage to link to]])</em> and how .twee files were exported (Twine was already doing some work for them, which was a plus). I also had asked my team, Ian and Bryce to check out Twine a few weeks back, but we needed to go over how it worked in class again since there were a lot of questions about Twine and the format we were using. I discovered that Twine tutorials are actually a bit squirrelly to find. :)</p>

<p>So, we began writing! Our priorities are the <strong>Party Hostess</strong>, since you talk to her first, the <strong>Editor</strong> as a central introducer of the plot and the key character you check in with, the Church of Light leader <strong>Senton</strong>, and our good old glowing water <strong>salesman</strong>. The last two have a bit more plot significance in the section we are prototyping. I've taken on Senton's conversations and that of a simple bartender. Half of Senton's conversations are done, with two more shorter ones to go. After this, I plan on working on the item examinations we have, since we're using the same twine system/formatt to explore items in the game as we are for talking to characters.</p>

<p>Most of my time these last few days have been coordinating with everyone. Design team is graciaously writing some dialogue along side us and have some questions. Our system right now is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Individuals pull a section to work on and tell me so I can indicate who is already doing what in our master writing Doc  </li>
<li>Once a piece is drafted, writing team reviews it for formatting, making sure the correct info is communicated to the player, and that there are no glaring errors(voice and style can still be worked on past this point)  </li>
<li>After review, it graduates to "Final Draft" status amd is sent to Design Team for additional review through playtesting. It also is sent to Programming Team to be implemented in the prototype.</li>
</ol>

<p>Oh, and here's an example of what our wip dialogue looks like right now. There are some variables poking out since this is just a demo in Twine, not in our actual project.</p>
