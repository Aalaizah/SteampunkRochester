Week 10</p>

<p>After finishing up our first prototype, the Design Team have made significant progress in working on making our second prototype. This time around, instead of creating a side story that tests out the mechanics of the game, we are focusing on recreating the beginning of the game on paper to test out the story flow and characters. </p>

<p>This actually was an important decision, as when we finished the first prototype we had to sit down and decide what was our next course of action. We could have refined the existing side story, made a new side story, or recreate the actual game and begin playtesting what people will actually be playing. There were pros and cons to both:</p>

<p>Refining would allow us to improve our existing mechanics, but would have us chained to a story we will have to leave behind.</p>

<p>Making a new story would allow us to test the flexibility of our mechanics, but would have us not spending enough time to test out the story of the main game.</p>

<p>Recreating the actual game would allow us to get our hands in and start making the final game a reality and testing out the story flow and characters, but would make us dependent on other teams to have our prototype accurate.</p>

<p>After some deliberation, we decided on making a prototype of the final game. We recreated all of the locations of the intro as well as the main characters that will appear. At this moment, we've finished the locations and are now waiting on the Writing Team to provide us with characters to populate our prototype. Hopefully we can get playtesting done soon.</p>
