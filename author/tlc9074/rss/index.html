The first character that we worked on is the Church of Light Party hostess. She is a character that acts as an introduction to the world of our game. She gives the player background on all the different factions, and the setting/plot of the game without shoving anything down the players throat. 

<p>We wrote the entire script for her character, and wrote it in a way that captures not only the time period but also the hostess's personality and dialect. The interaction between her and the player character I feel is done really well. The responses that Aleksei (player character) has are also done really well. </p>

<p>I looked up Russian sayings to help make the characters more genuine and realistic, because it wouldn not make sense for someone from Russia to be using American sayings while he was not born and raised here. They are not overly used, nor are they extremely foreign which allows the player to both understand what he is saying and get a feel for the character himself. </p>

<p>We are going to start prototyping this scene with the party hostess and Aleksei, as well as begin to start working on the script of another character. We do not know who this character will be just yet, but we are leaning towards the water salesman at the canals.</p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/design-team-week-11/<guid ispermalink="false">372cef6d-c5e4-47f0-9559-e6f6a1c67724</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Sun, 19 Apr 2015 21:48:22 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description>The past couple week we have been working with writing team to gain more infomation about the different characters and locations. Using this information we have been able to start on a paper prototype for the actual game. The previous prototype was a success and we learned a great deal about the mechanics of the game as well as how people would play it, or react to certain situations.

<p>Due to the success with our first prototype, and learning that our mechanics work well, we have decided to go ahead and actually start prototyping the actual game's storyline. This will allow us to test the games logic and course of events to see if it plays out well. We can tweak certain aspects if it does not work out. </p>

<p>As of right now we are on a temporary hold as we wait for the characters scripts to be finished. Even though design team is not currently doing anything, we are still working with other teams so we are not sitting around doing nothing. </p>

<p>Writing team has aske dus to help with some characters scripts. This week we will be working on the script of the Church of Light party host. </p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/design-team-week-10/<guid ispermalink="false">f5829a12-0518-4f05-b786-4e36aec3f7aa</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Tue, 07 Apr 2015 14:36:22 GMT</pubdate></item></channel>
