Week 10

<p>After finishing up our first prototype, the Design Team have made significant progress in working on making our second prototype. This time around, instead of creating a side story that tests out the mechanics of the game, we are focusing on recreating the beginning of the game on paper to test out the story flow and characters. </p>

<p>This actually was an important decision, as when we finished the first prototype we had to sit down and decide what was our next course of action. We could have refined the existing side story, made a new side story, or recreate the actual game and begin playtesting what people will actually be playing. There were pros and cons to both:</p>

<p>Refining would allow us to improve our existing mechanics, but would have us chained to a story we will have to leave behind.</p>

<p>Making a new story would allow us to test the flexibility of our mechanics, but would have us not spending enough time to test out the story of the main game.</p>

<p>Recreating the actual game would allow us to get our hands in and start making the final game a reality and testing out the story flow and characters, but would make us dependent on other teams to have our prototype accurate.</p>

<p>After some deliberation, we decided on making a prototype of the final game. We recreated all of the locations of the intro as well as the main characters that will appear. At this moment, we've finished the locations and are now waiting on the Writing Team to provide us with characters to populate our prototype. Hopefully we can get playtesting done soon.</p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/week-10/<guid ispermalink="false">3a255334-61b4-4ce2-a169-d140a0b1c9be</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Tue, 07 Apr 2015 14:19:50 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description>Steampunk Production Studio Blog Post <br>
Week 8

<p>After several weeks of the design team sitting down and merely talking about our ideas for how our game should be made, I finally managed to produce something tangible for the team: a prototype. I'm a very big fan of early stage prototypes, as they're the first step into making a game go from an idea into an actual living and evolving creation. I wouldn't have waited this long if I could, but other groups weren't as eager to prototype as I was.</p>

<p>Working on the prototype was simple. I listed down the most essential mechanics that our game would require in order to function and strung them together in order to see what works, what doesn't, and what needs a closer eye on when working in the final game. I made the explicit decision to make a paper prototype instead of a computer one. Our game is easily translated into a paper format, and there was very little that was lost in translation when creating the prototype.</p>

<p>Another explicit decision I made when creating the paper prototype was creating a side story to the main game instead of trying to do the main story in a condensed format. I must admit the main reason I went that route was because it felt the most fun approach to take this, however there were other reasons I believe this was the correct decision. Playtesting the story was not the goal of this prototype, especially considering that the story is still not complete. Creating a small side story that did not impact the plot of the main game made it easy to create a small self contained world within our created world, and allowed for quicker NPC and asset creation. By having a side story, we were able to playtest with a complete story and focus on the mechanics, as was the goal.</p>

<p>When the prototype was complete, we playtested it with 4 different people, all of which had varying levels of knowledge of the game and prototype. I regret not playtesting more, but I was able to playtest with someone who knew nothing about the game or prototype, so I can be comforted in that aspect. While playtesting, I roleplayed the NPCs and gave the players index cards with evidence drawn on them while they travelled from location to location on a paper board I made. It was an interesting experience, especially since the writing was not set in stone (another error on my part). It made me think on my feet, and I got a first hand look at the struggles that our game's writing will have.</p>

<p>The most important lesson I received out of this paper prototype was that the prototype should have existed before now. But allowing bygones be bygones, the paper prototype showed that most of our game's mechanics work on a fundamental level and don't shatter to pieces when being played. The design team needs to be very careful when creating our game's flow. The writing, gameplay, and locations must flow logically and naturally for our game to work. While the playtesters complimented the prototype's flow, I'm still not convinced that we'll be able to ace it in our final game when it's much more expansive.</p>

<p>The design team is already hard at work for the next prototype, in which we're testing the actual story. I'm excited.</p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/week-8/<guid ispermalink="false">6bb54169-e54d-47ab-afb2-309645cbfa67</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Fri, 20 Mar 2015 14:20:00 GMT</pubdate></item></channel>
