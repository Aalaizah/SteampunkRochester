Right now we have the major starting scene in the Editor's office, but we're trying to come up with others as well. I made an example file to try to establish a personality for the Salesman, but so far I haven't received any real feedback on how people liked it. I'm going to expand on it and try to make a full-blown scene regarding him. Hopefully then people will comment on my work so I can better myself and the content we're trying to produce.]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/ian-suozzi-status-report-4/<guid ispermalink="false">8d25bd15-5389-4d5f-a08e-4a7ea07885ff</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Mon, 20 Apr 2015 22:08:22 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description>Good news! We've finally got to start experimenting with dialogue for the characters. I myself was assigned to the Salesman, a minor NPC. Admittedly he wasn't my first choice, but I think I found a way to have fun with him, and in turn make him more entertaining and memorable than he was probably originally envisioned.

<p>However, we've all hit a snag in regards with "Twine" though. It happens to be all of ours first time using the program, so we're having a little trouble figuring it out. Fortunately, one of the students outside the writing team, Tyler Gerber, is offering his assistance to us. In exchange though, we have to write all of our dialogue scripts in a specific format in "Twine". He'll send us the instructions on how to do so, so we should be fine for now.</p>

<p>We also happened to work on a character relationship chart. It may not be as noteworthy as what else has been accomplished this week, but it will be good reference point for how we want certain characters to act and behave towards each other.</p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/ian-suozzi-status-report-3/<guid ispermalink="false">98a27968-1e0f-4153-bcde-452a0b17719d</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Thu, 09 Apr 2015 20:51:55 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description>Week 9: Our most noteworthy progress this week was writing down a summary of the story in a more natural reading format, instead of looking like a bunch of notes written down. This was primarily created for Richard Dansky to take a look at, but this can benefit us as well whenever we need to review any details (and with this, we only need to scroll through one-and-a-half pages).

<p>In addition to our summary, we have finally come up with names for our other two main characters ("Peter" for "Fluffy", and "Sean" for "Scruffy"). Unfortunately, there seems to be a disagreement amongst our team over whether or not we should keep these names. While I know this shouldn't be a major issue, I really hope this doesn't go on longer than it needs to be.</p>

<p>Lastly, for the ending to the First Act (Peter's portion), we discussed the possibility of having alcohol from both rival Mafia families being found in the Church of Light's possession.</p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/ian-suozzi-status-report-2/<guid ispermalink="false">ccd0c176-096d-4d19-8222-81ef8197771d</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Thu, 02 Apr 2015 20:18:32 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description>It has been eight weeks since this class has started and everyone began working on this "Steampunk Rochester" game. I have been assigned to the writing team for this project, which seems to be a good fit for me. So far, we've managed to create a basic foundation for the story, including a general summary, a list of the main characters and their major traits, and multiple possible endings for where we can focus on what direction to guide the plot to to our final destination.

<p>Admittedly, it seems a little barren after eight weeks, but I suppose that could be attributed to the fact that there are only three of us on the writing staff. Still though, the fact that we don't even have names for any of the characters besides "Sophie" troubles me a bit. That name didn't even come from any of us, but someone from the design team instead. Then again, I could be simply overestimating how much we could get done in this amount of time. And even though it wasn't the writing team who came up with our only named character, we are very much grateful for any and all outside help and suggestions from the other teams.</p>

<p>We are about to start writing dialogue soon, so hopefully progress will pick up soon. It seems to be a specialty of mine when it comes to my stories, so maybe I'll be able to contribute a great amount for this portion. We're also going to focus on how certain dialogue choices and actions will affect the outcome of the plot, so be sure to look forward to that.</p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/ian-suozzi-status-report-1/<guid ispermalink="false">d12dd651-e04f-4a38-8c65-c88a43abcf2b</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Fri, 20 Mar 2015 04:49:57 GMT</pubdate></item></channel>
