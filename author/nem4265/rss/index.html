<p>This site was not working for me for the past two blog posts, so I've been emailing them to Prof. Jacobs and Alex. I've finally gotten access and back logged my previous weeks. Please read over those first. Thanks.</p>

<p>This week there wasn't much to be done on programming team. We're currently waiting for art to start building the world up. I was able to get the permissions from Alex to push my changes to the git server. I posted my how-to under programming team's discussions in myCourses. I also posted in Art Team's threads about my how-to since they will probably be the ones adding in the art. It's not yet decided who will do it. If Art Team is too bogged down with making the art, then most likely programming team will pick it up. </p>

<p>We also did our peer reviews this week. We developed a schedule with deadlines for the remaining weeks at school. I think programming team is on schedule for hitting those deadlines. </p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/natasha-post-4/<guid ispermalink="false">5b2c98f3-6f28-41e5-902b-3200e8417bb6</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Fri, 17 Apr 2015 18:24:49 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description><em>Sent by email dated Ap, 3rd</em>

<p>Natasha M., Programming team</p>

<p>This past two week since my last blog have been very productive for programming team. We had break but decided to assign work to everyone over it. The task I had was to implement the map functionality of the game. This I did with Tim from programming team. We were able to collaborate and finish it before the self-inflicted deadline. When we all came back, we looked over everyone's work and discussed the issues we ran into and things we still needed to address. For me, the next task is cleaning up the code Tim and I wrote and get the system organized so art team can have an easy go of it when they start adding in the art. </p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/natasha-post-2/<guid ispermalink="false">52f7c696-f333-40a5-b233-aa6a57ba75d2</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Fri, 17 Apr 2015 18:19:12 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description>Natasha Martinez, Programming Team

<p>This week I was busy making updates to the level and location builder. After completing it over the weekend with Tim, I was able to change it to use better naming conventions. I also started a write up for a how-to for others in the class to proceed in creating locations and levels themselves. There seems to be a mix up with the permissions on the git so the changes are not pushed yet. As soon as that gets sorted, I'll push the updates.   </p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/natasha-post-3/<guid ispermalink="false">a6a564f3-6756-4876-b8c8-e7ef6334ee2a</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Fri, 17 Apr 2015 18:18:57 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description>I'm Natasha and I'm on the programming team.
