They are now colored and just need to be resized for the game since they are at a higher resolution than they need to be.

<p>Now I am working on creating a background for the high society party. I have begun to grab reference images and started a base layout for the background. For the immediate future we need to just get temporary pictures. However, by next week we are trying to get maybe two to three of the backgrounds done by the end of the week.</p>

<p>In order to complete this I will finish designing the background this weekend. Then by Tuesday I will have finalized lines. From there I will color the scene and add any final touches. Then it will be ready to be implemented into the game.</p>

<p>The main issue for this milestone is is getting the proper angle for the background image. It has to be at an interesting angle, but still be able to fit the characters and anything else required to be in the background. To overcome this, I am looking for different angles to draw the scene from until I find something I feel is sufficient, and then doing something more detailed after. This will make the transition to the final concept much easier.</p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/art-team-timothy-reuter-4/<guid ispermalink="false">ac793e7a-3bff-4d46-88b7-ffa12d917f47</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Sun, 19 Apr 2015 21:06:34 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description>Since the last post we have been hard at work on the secondary characters. For these characters I have been trying to instill their personalities into their designs. Most of the secondary characters designs are finalized and are in the stage of having a fine tuned set of lines and color added to them. 

<p>The most trouble with the characters were the scientist and the sketchy salesmen. The scientist has a steam punk jetpack as a defining characteristic. The sketchy salesmen needed to look 'sketchy' which was hard to figure out how to visualize. Ultimately I came up with a design for the jet pack for the scientist. The salesman ended up having a very interesting looking "briefcase." I also gave him a very unique face as well as small details that when put together just makes him look like he is selling some weird stuff. These two characters should be done before next class.</p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/art-team-timothy-reuter-2/<guid ispermalink="false">2533e535-7f60-4378-8a75-282f8442c43c</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Fri, 03 Apr 2015 00:41:43 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description>General

<p>I am Timothy Reuter. I am part of the art team.</p>

<p>Up to this point I have been working mostly with character concepts and small bits towards background work and a map. I started on a 3D block out of a map of Rochester, but realizing that was too much work for the time we had, it was scraped early on.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>In terms of background work, not too much has been done. We just gathered art to give us a feel of the background and where we want to go with it.</p>

<h3 id="characters">Characters</h3>

<p>Most of the work went into characters. For each of the main characters I have done a concept sketch. Then in the next meeting we talk about parts of each that we like and come up with a closer to final design. In terms of final designs I worked on Fluffy. I added a color scheme to it and now we have a very close to final design for him. </p>

<p>After the main characters had their final designs we divided up secondary characters and I have begun designing them for our next milestone.</p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/timothy-reuter-art-group/<guid ispermalink="false">1895cbf4-69a4-4685-bb20-55ac519b5127</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Thu, 19 Mar 2015 21:58:24 GMT</pubdate></item></channel>
