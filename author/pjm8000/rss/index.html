So it appears that I made a mistake and didn't exactly do the first three posts. But I've been keeping up in class for the most part.

<p>First, I do have character art, but I'm having issues uploading the images to imgur, then linking them here. Probably will need to sort that out as soon as I can. But hopefully Google Drive does the trick. Actually, it doesn't. Crap. Back to imgur's "email-to-upload" plan! Jeez, that finally works.</p>

<p>So we got a Bartender here, <br>

<p>And a street thug here. <br>

<p>I have other pictures, and I'll try to upload them as soon as possible. <br>
The other part is that I've been tasked with is drawing a bar environment, which I'll be happy to have ready for Tuesday's class, possibly Thursday if it needs refinement.</p>

<p>So yeah, best first post ever? Woooo.</p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/pete-michor-post-4/<guid ispermalink="false">14b14bc2-fe44-4e68-9ffa-1c8bea1a5c3d</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Mon, 20 Apr 2015 12:57:48 GMT</pubdate></item></channel>
