I was really excited to be using Twine for a project since I find it very fun to play with the structure of stories in it. Programming team had some formatting requirements for their <strong>Twine to Unity</strong> program, but adding those on top of Twine's formatting wasn't too difficult.

<p>There were some communication errors initially. Programming team didn't understand how Twine's choice system worked <em>([[This is link test AND the passage to link to]], [[This is link text|This is the Passage to link to]])</em> and how .twee files were exported (Twine was already doing some work for them, which was a plus). I also had asked my team, Ian and Bryce to check out Twine a few weeks back, but we needed to go over how it worked in class again since there were a lot of questions about Twine and the format we were using. I discovered that Twine tutorials are actually a bit squirrelly to find. :)</p>

<p>So, we began writing! Our priorities are the <strong>Party Hostess</strong>, since you talk to her first, the <strong>Editor</strong> as a central introducer of the plot and the key character you check in with, the Church of Light leader <strong>Senton</strong>, and our good old glowing water <strong>salesman</strong>. The last two have a bit more plot significance in the section we are prototyping. I've taken on Senton's conversations and that of a simple bartender. Half of Senton's conversations are done, with two more shorter ones to go. After this, I plan on working on the item examinations we have, since we're using the same twine system/formatt to explore items in the game as we are for talking to characters.</p>

<p>Most of my time these last few days have been coordinating with everyone. Design team is graciaously writing some dialogue along side us and have some questions. Our system right now is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Individuals pull a section to work on and tell me so I can indicate who is already doing what in our master writing Doc  </li>
<li>Once a piece is drafted, writing team reviews it for formatting, making sure the correct info is communicated to the player, and that there are no glaring errors(voice and style can still be worked on past this point)  </li>
<li>After review, it graduates to "Final Draft" status amd is sent to Design Team for additional review through playtesting. It also is sent to Programming Team to be implemented in the prototype.</li>
</ol>

<p>Oh, and here's an example of what our wip dialogue looks like right now. There are some variables poking out since this is just a demo in Twine, not in our actual project.</p>

Week 9

<p>So this week, writing team finished up the overall plot summary. This helps us all see the big picture and make sure we're all on the same page. I spent most of my time trying to figure out what the suffragists are doing as a faction, so I suggested that for them, we focus less on the group, and more on a few "extremists" within them. This would give us some defined characters to talk to (if we were doing that side of the story, since our Russian won't talk to them much) and I also thought it would be a good way to tie in the industrial side of Rochester in the 1920s. Our more militant suffragists work at a factory, where they may or may not have been dumping some chemical(or otherwise) waste into the river. Or at least, then knew what was going on...</p>

<p>I am playing with suggesting the idea of making sure we have a narrow character list. Not too narrow that everyone in the story is "involved" in the McGuffin, but narrow as in, characters from all three sections of the story (where each journalist is focused) are connected between all three. For example, our Russian might see and being able to have cheerful conversation with a suffragist that our woman journalist is grilling for details about these rumors. Of course, that's the dream if we could finish this. Right now, most of these people will jut have one job, but ideally, we would repurpose them in ways that flesh them out as people.</p>

<p>We've just finished our heavy brainstorming phrase and hopefully we will get this mystery on the road. Even starting backward and building from there, clues are hard. I've done a lot of writing, but never a mystery so it's going to be a lot of guess and check for how much/how little/is this clue even in the right place.</p>

<p>We also named(not final) our three main characters Fluffy, Suffy, and Scruffy, so that they can be identified by the average person. Aleksei is our Russian Duke, Sophie is our American woman cutting it in the man's world of journalism, and Kieran is our gruff but good Irish immigrant Great War veteran turned photographer. </p>

<p>Next week, we will start working with Twine to make our dialogue branches and I am really excited for this. In prepping for it, I am building a character connection chart to see where each of our characters, major and minor, stand, their relationships to all the other characters, their motivations, and just other blurbs that make them them. I want to build it in Twine for Twine's nifty tree structure, but it's hard to show off that way, so I am using Excel.</p>

<p>Meet our main characters so far(minus art) <br>
1.       Aleksei <br>
•    Duke from Russia
•    Fled from Revolution, made Canada his new homeland
•    Very polite, but brief/privileged? sense of humor
•    Older, in his 40s/50s?
•    Egotistical, makes himself seem more important?
•    Seeking fame
•    Not a communist!!!, ran away from them</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Sophie <br>
•    Peppy on the outside, distrustful, independent, manipulative but nice
•    late 20s, early 30s
•    Shapeshifter – very good at fitting herself into situations, changes over the story, provides alternate viewpoint as female in man’s world/during women's suffrage
•    “Truth seeker” – prove herself as the ultimate journalist and that she can do this job better
•    Smokes?
•    think about why she doesn’t trust people - was possibly manipulated by a prominent figure in her past, maybe a lover or caretaker, now employs similar tactics in day-to-day work</p></li>
<li><p>Kieran <br>
•    Sarcastic, gruff, scruffy, Irish, generally good guy
•    early 30s?
•    seeking to get away from mafia influence?
o    pay them off, maybe become more respectable? <br>
o    Has friends in mafia <br>
•    Drinks and maybe smokes
•    Steam powered prosthetic arm - lost in war
•    thinks of draft as work/volunteers - hopes can get better work after
•    definitely has friends (war, drinking, siblings)
•    family guy </p></li>

I'm a bit more familiar with the initial world but there's a lot there and I enjoy seeing other people find/make interesting things.

<p>I'm also a <strong>creative writer</strong> so I naturally gravitated to the writing team. We're been tasked with a large chunk of the game for just three people, so the going is a bit slow. But it was cool to have a lot of help and brainstorming with the rest of the production team early on and to know we can rely on them for input later.</p>

<p>So, writing team has was tasked with finishing an overall story for our primary main character, <strong>Fluffy</strong>, the Russian pseudo-Duke who fled from his homeland. His character is still a work in progress, but he's generally driven by fame and maybe a little fortune. He wants to be known for something and give people a reason not to look down on him, but rather to look up to him. With the help of the art team, we want him to be more of a high class kind of guy, and probably no nonsense. </p>

<p>So, his story is well in the works. Because we're basically building a <strong>mystery game with multiple ending</strong> options, it's difficult for use to get rolling on the overall story. <em>We've started with the different endings</em> that we want the player to have, since those are central to the game. Currently, we're organizing clues and other bits of information to see what it is we need to point us toward each ending. We're slowly figuring out what locations and people we need that are natural environments for each of those pieces to be found. Since the gameplay allows the player to pick locations in any order, there is <strong>no set chronological order</strong> to spaces, which means we need to write each scene as a contained piece that knows what other scenes the player has experienced already.</p>

<p>It is quite a challenge.</p>

<p>Design team was very adamant about getting some locations, so we worked up a list for that, which helped us figure out potential people we might meet(useful or not) and we're currently going through location by location determining what characters might give the player what info, if there is anything to find, or info to be had from a character later after talking to someone else or doing something else.</p>

<p>We really want the player to work a bit in this game. I'm a big fan of <em>MYST</em> and how much of the story has to be read and understood by the player. It doesn't explicitly tell you what you need to do to solve puzzles or why you are doing something. I also love the misleading elements in <em>MYST</em> where one brother says he is right and the other brothers says, no, he is right, and they both just sound crazy. It's the player's choice to read the library, figure out puzzles, and fix the books. And ultimately, they have to make a decision themselves where they can't be sure of the outcomes.</p>

<p>I want to infuse some of that  <strong>uncertainty and self reliance on the player</strong>. If we have documents the character picks up, the player must read those, there isn't a summary. None of that "the main character voices their inner thoughts about the object to the player." or the game taking notes for you. Ideally, our game won't just lead the player by the hand. <em>MYST</em> made an admirer out of me there. lol</p>

<p>So, right now, we have a finished summary of the big events, and are piecing together <strong>Fluffy's storyline</strong>. We'll hopefully have something ready to be turned into location/scene based scripts. Hopefully those will be started next week. And from there also, we can give the programming team a basic script to run through twine. It's a bit slower going than people would like with three people, but it is enjoyable.</p>

<p>We're also planning with the design and programming teams how the dialogue structure will work. We'll be using Twine and parsing it into Unity. The general idea is the player will have <strong>parallel branching</strong> choices, being able to pick a topic, and within that, choose how they say something or specifically what they say (tell information, be evasive, or be rude or nice). They may also be able to present some evidence to npcs, who will either have no idea or will start an action/other conversation.</p>
