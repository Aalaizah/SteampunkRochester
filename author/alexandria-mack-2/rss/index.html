<p>The past couple of weeks have been pretty hectic. The art team worked hard over spring break to start getting more of the characters</p>

<h4 id="design">Design</h4>

<p>Design team has completed a paper prototype that allowed them to test out the mechanics they have come up with. They were only able to test it with a few people, but they're working on another paper prototype that also includes actual story elements along with the mechanics. They will hopefully be able to playtest this second prototype with more people. It's especially important that they focus on testing with people who don't know anything about the game.</p>

<h4 id="writing">Writing</h4>

<p>Writing team has been working on figuring out some endings to help make their dialogue have a direction to it. We were also able to have Richard Dansky look over some of their stuff and he was able to give a lot of good tips. Things are looking good for the writing team, however they're a little behind schedule. I'm going to be working with them and design team to see what we can do to move things further quicker.</p>

<h4 id="programming">Programming</h4>

<p>Programming team has made some really awesome progress. They have an interactable map so you can move to new locations, a camera that allows you to move around each location, and are currently working towards getting the inventory system implemented. </p>

<h4 id="playtestingcomingup">Playtesting Coming Up</h4>

<p>Originally we had planned to start running playtesting sessions this coming week, and while we'll be able to playtest the paper prototypes, the story isn't far enough along to add it into what programming team has. Hopefully we'll be able to get that back on track and do playtesting the week after. The end of the semester is coming up quick, so it's important that we get what we need completed in a timely manner.</p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/spring-break-and-beyond/<guid ispermalink="false">638ce51b-5782-4918-9c25-2d7dfda72e54</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Sat, 04 Apr 2015 22:18:06 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description>The Beginnning

<p>Production studio has taken a bit longer than most of my other project based courses to really start ramping up. It's definitely nice to have had that breather at the beginning of the semester to get everything else started off right. Before we even broke into teams of who's going to do what we had to start getting a concrete plan of what the game would look like. We had to familiarize ourselves with the content that was given to us, and the time period it needed to take place in before we could decide on even a genre of game.</p>

<h4 id="productionfun">Production Fun</h4>

<p>After we finally got the game off the ground the next step for me was to set up this blog. It's still sort of a work in progress, it might need to be migrated to a new server that can handle the load a little better at some point, but for now things look like they're working. Each of the teams seem to be finally getting things set in stone and we have some very basic functionality in a grey box done. It should be interesting to see where things go from here, but it looks like it will be a really cool game.</p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/steampunk-rochester-ramp-up/<guid ispermalink="false">521f9933-976d-4d3b-a879-9962777c7cf1</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Fri, 20 Mar 2015 03:59:47 GMT</pubdate></item></channel>
