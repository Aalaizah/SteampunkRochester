Since it's very behind compared to the rest of Steampunk Rochester, design team decided the best use of our time would be to help writing team out with some of the dialog.

<p>First of all, we all know we're using Twine. In my Interactive Narrative class we're using RenPy, but I prefer Twine by far. Twine's UI is a lot more visual, creating notecards for different parts of conversations and arrows connecting them. It's so much more intuitive than RenPy, which is basically just a very very long script. You don't know if you messed up until you try to run it, while Twine has very reactive feedback. If you try to link to a card that doesn't exist yet, it will ask if you would like to add that card.</p>

<p>We started with the first person you talk to in the game, a socialite at a high society party. Before jumping into writing we wanted to figure out the character and her personality. We went straight to the whiteboard and started mapping her out.</p>

<p>We knew we wanted her to be connected to Aleksei through her brother, his friend. You talk to her at the party because she's the only one you know, and you were invited because she is the hostess. We wanted the conversation with her to teach the player about the world without obvious, boring exposition of explaining everything that the character would already know. Mario was very demandant of her not being snooty, which became a very important part of her character. She's friendly and her main goal is to be liked by everybody and be popular. She's always in the know and is very outgoing and easy to talk to. She's up to date on all the current rumors, phrases, and slang.</p>

<p>We came to adore this Matty Ray, and I ended up writing most of her dialog myself. I put myself in her shoes, thinking of ways to let you get to know this character while also teaching the player. Throughout asking her questions, trading stories, and very natural feeling conversation, the player learns a lot not only about her and the world but about their own character as well.</p>

<p>We made sure to add a lot of 1920's slang and phrases into her speaking because we knew she'd be very up on all of that. Her most used word is "fabulous", which we thought fit her personality extremely well. She's in the Church of Light because it's the popular thing to do, and later on when the player learns about the Church of Light and that everybody at that part was part of it, we hope that they'll pick up on this nuance. She doesn't really know much about them, just that everybody who's anybody is participating.</p>

<p>Matty is currently my favorite character, but as of right now she's only in the intro. I can see her showing up again later in the game, but maybe not in the scope of this class. Regardless, I'm looking forward to writing more characters.</p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/design-team-does-dialog/<guid ispermalink="false">d793d60e-d592-4179-b2bc-3931834986f5</guid><category></category><category></category><category></category><category></category><creator></creator><pubdate>Fri, 17 Apr 2015 13:32:53 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description>Being on design team is always interesting. We deal with all the teams in order to make sure nobody strays from the vision, and that everybody is on the same page. But simply dealing with each other is always interesting as well. We're constantly trying to evolve what we're doing and give it more depth.

<p>Since our first paper prototype was a success and showed proof of concept mechanic-wise, we decided that the next step was to make a prototype from the game's actual story. The trouble here is that we have no script yet, so we're not sure how to move on. We've made the locations, but what next? We've been talking to writing team a lot working on characters and trying to think of evidence and figure out how the multiple endings will work, and I feel like that might be the most important use of our time.</p>

<p>Writing team has been posed with a challenge and I think that if we helped them out we could move a lot faster. We need to get a script done, but they're not done with the storyline yet so cannot move on. If design team can help out with that, then they can get a script done and we can do our paper prototype and they can get it into the game. That's the new goal.</p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/design-team-keeps-on-going/<guid ispermalink="false">8f92f6ea-0028-42f7-8968-5082c4af4217</guid><category></category><creator></creator><pubdate>Tue, 07 Apr 2015 00:29:27 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description>I don't know how to start this blog, so I'm just gonna dive in. Designing investigative journalism games leads to a lot of influence from games like Phoenix Wright, but we definitely wanted to give it a different feel. Also the fact that Steampunk Rochester is a student game made in one semester made it so we had to really narrow our focus to make something solid, fun, and playable. We figured that to start we were just going to have a map and conversations; when you click on a location it brings you straight to a conversation with a person, then you would go through that conversation and back to the map.

<p>But that's seriously underestimating programming team. Especially with Twine to Unity, that was too simple. Somebody mentioned platforming levels to travel between locations, but we did a hard pass on that one. Literally nobody wants that. Whoever mentioned that, for shame. We decided to add a time mechanic, where traveling would take a half hour and you would always spend an hour at a location. However, the user wouldn't be forced to micromanage their time like this: they'd simply know if it was morning, afternoon, or night, which changes whether or not some characters are in a location or not. I'm honestly not entirely sold on this, and think maybe we could switch to being able to go one place in the morning, one in the afternoon, and one at night. It adds another element of strategy, and since events take place over a week or so you'll always have a chance to catch up if you miss someone. I don't know, it's something to discuss after break.</p>

<p>Here's how the game flow is gonna go. The base screen is a map, the map in the editor's office. Each location has a pushpin to denote it, and strings tied between them as paths. Hovering over a pushpin will bring up a tooltip, perhaps in the form of a sticky note, that says what the location is and perhaps who is there (we talked about just saying the characters who are always there if you've been there before, but if we do that then players might assume that no new people are there and that might pose a problem). There's a little photograph of your character showing where you are, and when you move to a new location he travels along the string.</p>

<p>When you get to a location, it opens up to a scene. You can click on different things in the scene to investigate, such as objects or people. If you click on a person you start a conversation with them. When you get to a point where you can bring up a topic, ask them a question, or respond, a box pops up with your options. If you are at a break in the conversation you can choose to present evidence, which will pull up a grid representing your inventory that holds all your evidence. But Tim's gonna talk more about the dialog system, so I'm not going to go into it.</p>

<p>I'm excited to see how the game turns out. Writing this blog also totally helped me think of why I'm not so set on some of the decisions we've made. When we get back I'll be sure to bring my issues up.</p>

<p>Deuces, bros.</p>
