Post 3 :) So since my last blog post I've digitalized and colored my four character drawings using my tablet. To reiteratate, the characters I drew were: Mercurio Mob Boss brothers, Ziccardi Mob Boss, and a very posh rich lady. So without further ado!

<p>Ziccardi Mob Boss: <br>

<p>Mercurio Mob Bosses: <br>

<p>Posh Lady: <br>

<p>I've also started working on backgrounds for scenes, mainly the Editor's Office. The biggest issue I faced with these designs is realizing NOW, post character drawing/coloring, that it's hard to design and draw backgrounds for each scene because each character already has an angle and body position. And if there are more than one or two characters in a scene (like the Editor's Office which should have 4) it becomes incredibly difficult because I have to design the scene (a very small room) so that all of the characters and their angles appear correct. I also want to talk to coding team about the screen panning in such a small room.</p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/art-team-sara-platner-post-3/<guid ispermalink="false">be061c0a-b54d-47b9-aced-22fde9f4d7a6</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Fri, 17 Apr 2015 16:24:33 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description>Since my last post I have drawn three secondary characters/NPCs. I was in charge of drawing four characters: the Mob Boss of the Ziccardi Family, the Mob Bosses of the Mercurio Family, and one of 'Fluffy's aristocratic friends. 

<p>For Joseph Ziccardi I drew inspiration from this photo: <br>

<p>For Mercurio brothers I drew inspiration from this photo: <br>

<p>For Fluffy's aristocrat I draw inspiration from this photo: <br>

<p>And then I ended up with these sketches: <br>

<p>Now I'll digilize the photos and color them in! The hardest part of these drawings were the Mob Men because I had to pay so much attention to their body language. The way they appear to be standing needed to be confidant and strong, which is hard for me because I typically only draw women. Oh and YES I will make the nice lady's hand smaller aha. </p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/art-team-sara-platner-post-2/<guid ispermalink="false">8dac95ce-9fa4-4154-9eb1-7f48b11f728f</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Thu, 02 Apr 2015 15:13:06 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description>My name is Sara Platner and I'm on the Art Team! So far the team and I have been working on designing and sketching the game's three main characters. The game will give the player those characters and let them choose who to play the game the with. As of right now our class is focusing on only one of the three characters: codename 'Fluffy'. If at the end of the semester Coding and Design team have time, the other two characters Suffy and Scruffy will be implemented more thoroughly. 

<p>That being said! I helped design/draw Suffy's basic layout:</p>

<p>I also worked with the group to create Scruffy. Then I finalized his sketch in the below picture. </p>

<p>Then I colored and finalized Scruffy: </p>

<p>I also created the post on MyCourses for Secondary Characters to be designed and drawn by certain group members. Hopefully we'll have those characters by after Spring Break! </p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/sara-platner-31915/<guid ispermalink="false">6f49b667-c5ed-4f47-bbe9-2846fe351086</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Thu, 19 Mar 2015 19:41:27 GMT</pubdate></item></channel>
