Talked with writing team to figure out how much the system will be used in order to scale the ranges for different emotions. (angry, neutral, happy) Decided that each node will also have a required emotion in order to better keep the parser from getting too bloated. Will have this feature implemented by the beginning of next week.]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/tyler-gerber-post-4/<guid ispermalink="false">a1b38beb-25bd-42c6-be00-d25d0495db80</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Thu, 16 Apr 2015 14:29:03 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description>Currently I need to implement a rough emotion system for the game so that character's happiness can go up and down based on choices selected in dialogue.

<p>update: after testing the changes, they seem to be working.</p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/tyler-gerber-post-2-452015/<guid ispermalink="false">9d5e0b51-fdf9-490b-a47a-b48184d10c83</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Sun, 05 Apr 2015 18:11:42 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description>I'm Tyler Gerber, member of the coding/development team. So far I've mostly worked on interpreting how one of our external tools (a twine to unity converter) will work. I ended up having to take a visit to the hospital last weekend so i was unable to work on much else aside from that and doing some small edits to some of the code my fellow members made (making our generic intractable class more modular for use in the entire game). My current plan going forward is to work on integrating some of our code as well as starting to make an inventory system that will tie in with our twine file parser so that certain options can only be selected and will only show up when a specific item is in the player's inventory.]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/tyler-gerber-3192015-post-1/<guid ispermalink="false">2bda2368-6609-4dcd-b1f1-498ebecc90dd</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Thu, 19 Mar 2015 21:29:13 GMT</pubdate></item></channel>
