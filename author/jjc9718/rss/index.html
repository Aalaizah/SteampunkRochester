But I was able to enjoy some BrickHack culture this weekend while working on setting up the new wireframe designs. My goal for this new wireframes are to better show what we want in our final designs. 

<p>One idea AJ and I were playing around with is placing the map on an angle so we can have a skybox in the background to help tell the time of the day. This would be better than just having a time of the day UI element floating the top left corner. This would be more dynamic. To test this idea, I took a map and imported it into Unity. I placed it on an empty object with a sprite renderer. We then placed 3D objects to simulate pins on the map. These objects in combination with Unity lighting makes some pretty cool shadows that we could use to also indicate the time of day.</p>

<p>Another idea we threw around was having dynamic text boxes on the screen to help liven up the dialogue screen. We wanted to stray away from the static text screen. </p>

<p>I plan to have another set of designs ready for review by next class.</p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/ui-dev-post-4/<guid ispermalink="false">7c5def18-a355-4f49-b246-5c704816cafd</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Mon, 20 Apr 2015 05:02:57 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description>While SJ was off I was a secret agent, attempting to foil Jackie's evil plans to destroy the ice caps. Well I was in our game extravaganza! The role playing aspects of the game really allowed for us to mess around with world building and storytelling. We may have been only able to play half of one game, but even the first half was enjoyable. 

<p>From there I have worked on the first round of wireframes for the user interface. I worked on all the primary user interactions in the game. This includes the map, pause, location, dialogue, and choices screens. I focused on making the user interactions easy and clear. My only issue with my design is the dialogue screen, and just how the game feels like any other visual novel.</p>

<p>I tried to draw inspiration from other point and click games. It is actually a bit difficult finding games that share both elements of a visual novel game and point &amp; click game. So I may have to work as I go with the UI, and try to stray away from the design I have for the dialogue screen.</p>

<p>I plan to play around with some more ideas.  I hope to have at least two more sets of designs for the teams to review. </p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/ui-dev-post-3/<guid ispermalink="false">3c2df79f-9155-4399-b135-5da9f97d286f</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Mon, 20 Apr 2015 04:50:38 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description>Programming team here is coming in strong after this break with nearly all of the core architecture taken care of. I was supposed to get a lot more work done this break, however I experienced an unexpected reaction to a shot that I had. It was literally the hit by the bus scenario. I was originally tasked with getting the choices to show up on the screen. I wasn’t able to do that, only being able to set up a majority of the logic necessary for said task to be completed. Thanks to Tyler’s debugging skills and knowledge of the parser, we were able to fix the issue.

<p>From this point on now, I am learning about the UI system that was implemented in Unity 4.6.1. This will be the version of Unity that we will use, and the new UI system was a major overhaul of the previous version. On top of that, I am also working on wireframe sketches for the game’s UI, including menu, game, and scene views.</p>

<p>At this point I am looking forward to start seeing art assets populating our game, and to start scripting out the story.  </p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/ui-dev-post-break/<guid ispermalink="false">14aeeac4-f96c-4466-8787-c3d90daaac10</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Sun, 05 Apr 2015 21:32:59 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description>For the first couple weeks working on Steampunk Rochester, the programming team focused on how we were going to handle development and what tools we would use. I took on the role of UI Developer, but since there isn’t much UI work to do at the moment I have been working with the programming team on basic mechanics for the game. This includes interactable objects, while others in the team worked on the movable scene.

<p>However, before I started even working on the interactable, we had to get the Twine2Unity parser working. For about a week, Tyler and I worked on reviewing how the parser imports files and parses it to text that would be read later in the game. After getting our appropriate demo working out, we then moved onto the interactable objects. I had prior experience last semester working with Unity’s GUI system. I also had experience with developing in game buttons as opposed to using the GUI system. So I pretty much used what I learned from that to create the initial interactable class. </p>

<p>Each interactable is a game object that has a sprite renderer and a bounding box to check for clicks, hovers, ect. Each interactable will have an idle sprite, hover sprite, and active sprite for each mouse event. Depending on what design team and art team wants to do, we may forgo the active sprite, which is just what would the sprite would look like when clicked. </p>

<p>At this point now, I will be working with others in the programming team on the inventory system, as well as working on wireframe sketches for the UI. Finally, some UI work!</p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/ui-dev-the-first-few-weeks/<guid ispermalink="false">f46d744d-49bf-4c84-9af8-26de9ab0d187</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Fri, 20 Mar 2015 16:03:04 GMT</pubdate></item></channel>
