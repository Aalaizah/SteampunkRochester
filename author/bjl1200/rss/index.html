I wrote a draft of the scene introducing the editor, which was reviewed by the group and will be finished as a final copy next week. Goals for next week include finishing both of the editor scenes (or finishing the first one and drafting the second scene), transferring them into .twee files, and reworking other dialogue from group members or design team. ]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/bryce-lockwood-writing-team-post-4/<guid ispermalink="false">075b08a0-7e58-47d9-91c6-bd1679c3d29b</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Fri, 17 Apr 2015 14:50:48 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description>This week, we discussed the breakdown and formatting of dialogue on Twine. Main accomplishments for the week were dividing the writing sections for the first few scenes. I will be writing dialogue for Fluffy and the Editor, with the main focus on the opening Editor sequence (with emphasis on dialogue between the Editor and Fluffy) and Fluffy samples for the party scene. Estimated delivery date for that section should be Tuesday, with tune-ups and fixes between then and Thursday. All work should be done on Twine, with possibly branching speech options (though no especially significant choices, with each speech option eventually bringing you to the same point).]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/bryce-lockwood-writing-team-post-3/<guid ispermalink="false">33d3e84d-1988-4b16-a512-0be57cd89567</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Fri, 10 Apr 2015 22:00:57 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description>This week, we wrote up a one-and-a-half page summary of the major elements of the game, including the setting, protagonists, important factions, and main summary of gameplay. We also contributed to the Richard Dansky discussion, asking relevant questions pertaining to the writing in general. Over the course of the week, we also made some minor tweaks to the writing, like adding actual names for some of the characters (disregarding debate over said names). Also discussed potential ending of First Act, regarding the discovery of alcohol from rival Mafia families being sent to the Church of Light.]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/bryce-lockwood-writing-team-post-2/<guid ispermalink="false">551ff60c-aa97-492f-8628-30c01da0ffb9</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Thu, 02 Apr 2015 14:34:40 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description>These past weeks, I've been working with the writing team to establish a framework for the main storylines, and elaborating on background details/evidence/interviews for the scenes. We have a full outline of the general plot, which gives a lead-in to all of the possible endings that could occur based on story events (including branches that won't necessarily get developed for the other two potential playable characters). We also have a list of events/interviews for each place in the game before the main climax (which we haven't decided on the full details of, but have some lead-ins). The general idea of places you can visit in-game has pretty much been established, with there currently being about 5-6 locations.]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/bryce-lockwood-writing-team-post-1/<guid ispermalink="false">2e20c695-b63c-4a92-8a6b-d0682f2a17a5</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Thu, 19 Mar 2015 14:31:43 GMT</pubdate></item></channel>
