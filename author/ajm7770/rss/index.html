Most of the engine work is done at this point, with the exception of creating the time of day and emotion systems. This week out team will be working the emotion system and communicating with the writing team about how these new systems will work in their workflow. We have finished the inventory system and the writers can easily add in lines for dialogue choices to use a certain item. This system has not yet been fully tested and will be put through its paces this week, catching for all possible edge cases and making sure our parser can handle them. Otherwise, our team is ready to start adding in art assets and text and just needs the finalized assets from the respective teams. ]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/programming-team-update-41315-41915/<guid ispermalink="false">56fede23-271a-4644-8900-5d19bf7bab01</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Tue, 21 Apr 2015 15:30:15 GMT</pubdate></item></channel>
