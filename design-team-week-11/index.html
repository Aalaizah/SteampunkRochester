        <section class="post-content">
            <p>This past week we have been working closely with writing team to futher flesh out characters and scripts. The first character that we worked on is the Church of Light Party hostess. She is a character that acts as an introduction to the world of our game. She gives the player background on all the different factions, and the setting/plot of the game without shoving anything down the players throat. </p>

<p>We wrote the entire script for her character, and wrote it in a way that captures not only the time period but also the hostess's personality and dialect. The interaction between her and the player character I feel is done really well. The responses that Aleksei (player character) has are also done really well. </p>

<p>I looked up Russian sayings to help make the characters more genuine and realistic, because it wouldn not make sense for someone from Russia to be using American sayings while he was not born and raised here. They are not overly used, nor are they extremely foreign which allows the player to both understand what he is saying and get a feel for the character himself. </p>

<p>We are going to start prototyping this scene with the party hostess and Aleksei, as well as begin to start working on the script of another character. We do not know who this character will be just yet, but we are leaning towards the water salesman at the canals.</p>
