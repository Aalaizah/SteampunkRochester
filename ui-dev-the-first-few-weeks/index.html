        <section class="post-content">
            <p>For the first couple weeks working on Steampunk Rochester, the programming team focused on how we were going to handle development and what tools we would use. I took on the role of UI Developer, but since there isn’t much UI work to do at the moment I have been working with the programming team on basic mechanics for the game. This includes interactable objects, while others in the team worked on the movable scene.</p>

<p>However, before I started even working on the interactable, we had to get the Twine2Unity parser working. For about a week, Tyler and I worked on reviewing how the parser imports files and parses it to text that would be read later in the game. After getting our appropriate demo working out, we then moved onto the interactable objects. I had prior experience last semester working with Unity’s GUI system. I also had experience with developing in game buttons as opposed to using the GUI system. So I pretty much used what I learned from that to create the initial interactable class. </p>

<p>Each interactable is a game object that has a sprite renderer and a bounding box to check for clicks, hovers, ect. Each interactable will have an idle sprite, hover sprite, and active sprite for each mouse event. Depending on what design team and art team wants to do, we may forgo the active sprite, which is just what would the sprite would look like when clicked. </p>

<p>At this point now, I will be working with others in the programming team on the inventory system, as well as working on wireframe sketches for the UI. Finally, some UI work!</p>
