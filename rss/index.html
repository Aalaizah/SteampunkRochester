Most of the engine work is done at this point, with the exception of creating the time of day and emotion systems. This week out team will be working the emotion system and communicating with the writing team about how these new systems will work in their workflow. We have finished the inventory system and the writers can easily add in lines for dialogue choices to use a certain item. This system has not yet been fully tested and will be put through its paces this week, catching for all possible edge cases and making sure our parser can handle them. Otherwise, our team is ready to start adding in art assets and text and just needs the finalized assets from the respective teams. ]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/programming-team-update-41315-41915/<guid ispermalink="false">56fede23-271a-4644-8900-5d19bf7bab01</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Tue, 21 Apr 2015 15:30:15 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description>We have finally started getting down on the nitty-gritty and began working on the actual scripts in "Twine". Right now we have the major starting scene in the Editor's office, but we're trying to come up with others as well. I made an example file to try to establish a personality for the Salesman, but so far I haven't received any real feedback on how people liked it. I'm going to expand on it and try to make a full-blown scene regarding him. Hopefully then people will comment on my work so I can better myself and the content we're trying to produce.]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/ian-suozzi-status-report-4/<guid ispermalink="false">8d25bd15-5389-4d5f-a08e-4a7ea07885ff</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Mon, 20 Apr 2015 22:08:22 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description>Hey there! So it appears that I made a mistake and didn't exactly do the first three posts. But I've been keeping up in class for the most part.

<p>First, I do have character art, but I'm having issues uploading the images to imgur, then linking them here. Probably will need to sort that out as soon as I can. But hopefully Google Drive does the trick. Actually, it doesn't. Crap. Back to imgur's "email-to-upload" plan! Jeez, that finally works.</p>

<p>So we got a Bartender here, <br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/SK0Ftni.png" alt="Bartender"></p>

<p>And a street thug here. <br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/ytStO2o.png" alt="Street Thug"></p>

<p>I have other pictures, and I'll try to upload them as soon as possible. <br>
The other part is that I've been tasked with is drawing a bar environment, which I'll be happy to have ready for Tuesday's class, possibly Thursday if it needs refinement.</p>

<p>So yeah, best first post ever? Woooo.</p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/pete-michor-post-4/<guid ispermalink="false">14b14bc2-fe44-4e68-9ffa-1c8bea1a5c3d</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Mon, 20 Apr 2015 12:57:48 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description>Interviews, a couple of those popped up and for the past few days I have been working on those. But I was able to enjoy some BrickHack culture this weekend while working on setting up the new wireframe designs. My goal for this new wireframes are to better show what we want in our final designs. 

<p>One idea AJ and I were playing around with is placing the map on an angle so we can have a skybox in the background to help tell the time of the day. This would be better than just having a time of the day UI element floating the top left corner. This would be more dynamic. To test this idea, I took a map and imported it into Unity. I placed it on an empty object with a sprite renderer. We then placed 3D objects to simulate pins on the map. These objects in combination with Unity lighting makes some pretty cool shadows that we could use to also indicate the time of day.</p>

<p>Another idea we threw around was having dynamic text boxes on the screen to help liven up the dialogue screen. We wanted to stray away from the static text screen. </p>

<p>I plan to have another set of designs ready for review by next class.</p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/ui-dev-post-4/<guid ispermalink="false">7c5def18-a355-4f49-b246-5c704816cafd</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Mon, 20 Apr 2015 05:02:57 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description>While SJ was off I was a secret agent, attempting to foil Jackie's evil plans to destroy the ice caps. Well I was in our game extravaganza! The role playing aspects of the game really allowed for us to mess around with world building and storytelling. We may have been only able to play half of one game, but even the first half was enjoyable. 

<p>From there I have worked on the first round of wireframes for the user interface. I worked on all the primary user interactions in the game. This includes the map, pause, location, dialogue, and choices screens. I focused on making the user interactions easy and clear. My only issue with my design is the dialogue screen, and just how the game feels like any other visual novel.</p>

<p>I tried to draw inspiration from other point and click games. It is actually a bit difficult finding games that share both elements of a visual novel game and point &amp; click game. So I may have to work as I go with the UI, and try to stray away from the design I have for the dialogue screen.</p>

<p>I plan to play around with some more ideas.  I hope to have at least two more sets of designs for the teams to review. </p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/ui-dev-post-3/<guid ispermalink="false">3c2df79f-9155-4399-b135-5da9f97d286f</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Mon, 20 Apr 2015 04:50:38 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description>This past week we have been working closely with writing team to futher flesh out characters and scripts. The first character that we worked on is the Church of Light Party hostess. She is a character that acts as an introduction to the world of our game. She gives the player background on all the different factions, and the setting/plot of the game without shoving anything down the players throat. 

<p>We wrote the entire script for her character, and wrote it in a way that captures not only the time period but also the hostess's personality and dialect. The interaction between her and the player character I feel is done really well. The responses that Aleksei (player character) has are also done really well. </p>

<p>I looked up Russian sayings to help make the characters more genuine and realistic, because it wouldn not make sense for someone from Russia to be using American sayings while he was not born and raised here. They are not overly used, nor are they extremely foreign which allows the player to both understand what he is saying and get a feel for the character himself. </p>

<p>We are going to start prototyping this scene with the party hostess and Aleksei, as well as begin to start working on the script of another character. We do not know who this character will be just yet, but we are leaning towards the water salesman at the canals.</p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/design-team-week-11/<guid ispermalink="false">372cef6d-c5e4-47f0-9559-e6f6a1c67724</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Sun, 19 Apr 2015 21:48:22 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description>I have been finalizing the secondary character designs I have been working on. They are now colored and just need to be resized for the game since they are at a higher resolution than they need to be.

<p>Now I am working on creating a background for the high society party. I have begun to grab reference images and started a base layout for the background. For the immediate future we need to just get temporary pictures. However, by next week we are trying to get maybe two to three of the backgrounds done by the end of the week.</p>

<p>In order to complete this I will finish designing the background this weekend. Then by Tuesday I will have finalized lines. From there I will color the scene and add any final touches. Then it will be ready to be implemented into the game.</p>

<p>The main issue for this milestone is is getting the proper angle for the background image. It has to be at an interesting angle, but still be able to fit the characters and anything else required to be in the background. To overcome this, I am looking for different angles to draw the scene from until I find something I feel is sufficient, and then doing something more detailed after. This will make the transition to the final concept much easier.</p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/art-team-timothy-reuter-4/<guid ispermalink="false">ac793e7a-3bff-4d46-88b7-ffa12d917f47</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Sun, 19 Apr 2015 21:06:34 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description>Natasha Martinez, Programming Team

<p>This site was not working for me for the past two blog posts, so I've been emailing them to Prof. Jacobs and Alex. I've finally gotten access and back logged my previous weeks. Please read over those first. Thanks.</p>

<p>This week there wasn't much to be done on programming team. We're currently waiting for art to start building the world up. I was able to get the permissions from Alex to push my changes to the git server. I posted my how-to under programming team's discussions in myCourses. I also posted in Art Team's threads about my how-to since they will probably be the ones adding in the art. It's not yet decided who will do it. If Art Team is too bogged down with making the art, then most likely programming team will pick it up. </p>

<p>We also did our peer reviews this week. We developed a schedule with deadlines for the remaining weeks at school. I think programming team is on schedule for hitting those deadlines. </p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/natasha-post-4/<guid ispermalink="false">5b2c98f3-6f28-41e5-902b-3200e8417bb6</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Fri, 17 Apr 2015 18:24:49 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description><em>Sent by email dated Ap, 3rd</em>

<p>Natasha M., Programming team</p>

<p>This past two week since my last blog have been very productive for programming team. We had break but decided to assign work to everyone over it. The task I had was to implement the map functionality of the game. This I did with Tim from programming team. We were able to collaborate and finish it before the self-inflicted deadline. When we all came back, we looked over everyone's work and discussed the issues we ran into and things we still needed to address. For me, the next task is cleaning up the code Tim and I wrote and get the system organized so art team can have an easy go of it when they start adding in the art. </p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/natasha-post-2/<guid ispermalink="false">52f7c696-f333-40a5-b233-aa6a57ba75d2</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Fri, 17 Apr 2015 18:19:12 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description>Natasha Martinez, Programming Team

<p>This week I was busy making updates to the level and location builder. After completing it over the weekend with Tim, I was able to change it to use better naming conventions. I also started a write up for a how-to for others in the class to proceed in creating locations and levels themselves. There seems to be a mix up with the permissions on the git so the changes are not pushed yet. As soon as that gets sorted, I'll push the updates.   </p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/natasha-post-3/<guid ispermalink="false">a6a564f3-6756-4876-b8c8-e7ef6334ee2a</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Fri, 17 Apr 2015 18:18:57 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description>Last week, we started writing our dialogue. I was really excited to be using Twine for a project since I find it very fun to play with the structure of stories in it. Programming team had some formatting requirements for their <strong>Twine to Unity</strong> program, but adding those on top of Twine's formatting wasn't too difficult.

<p>There were some communication errors initially. Programming team didn't understand how Twine's choice system worked <em>([[This is link test AND the passage to link to]], [[This is link text|This is the Passage to link to]])</em> and how .twee files were exported (Twine was already doing some work for them, which was a plus). I also had asked my team, Ian and Bryce to check out Twine a few weeks back, but we needed to go over how it worked in class again since there were a lot of questions about Twine and the format we were using. I discovered that Twine tutorials are actually a bit squirrelly to find. :)</p>

<p>So, we began writing! Our priorities are the <strong>Party Hostess</strong>, since you talk to her first, the <strong>Editor</strong> as a central introducer of the plot and the key character you check in with, the Church of Light leader <strong>Senton</strong>, and our good old glowing water <strong>salesman</strong>. The last two have a bit more plot significance in the section we are prototyping. I've taken on Senton's conversations and that of a simple bartender. Half of Senton's conversations are done, with two more shorter ones to go. After this, I plan on working on the item examinations we have, since we're using the same twine system/formatt to explore items in the game as we are for talking to characters.</p>

<p>Most of my time these last few days have been coordinating with everyone. Design team is graciaously writing some dialogue along side us and have some questions. Our system right now is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Individuals pull a section to work on and tell me so I can indicate who is already doing what in our master writing Doc  </li>
<li>Once a piece is drafted, writing team reviews it for formatting, making sure the correct info is communicated to the player, and that there are no glaring errors(voice and style can still be worked on past this point)  </li>
<li>After review, it graduates to "Final Draft" status amd is sent to Design Team for additional review through playtesting. It also is sent to Programming Team to be implemented in the prototype.</li>
</ol>

<p>Oh, and here's an example of what our wip dialogue looks like right now. There are some variables poking out since this is just a demo in Twine, not in our actual project.</p>

Post 3 :) So since my last blog post I've digitalized and colored my four character drawings using my tablet. To reiteratate, the characters I drew were: Mercurio Mob Boss brothers, Ziccardi Mob Boss, and a very posh rich lady. So without further ado!

<p>Ziccardi Mob Boss: <br>

<p>Mercurio Mob Bosses: <br>

<p>Posh Lady: <br>
<img src="http://my-ghost-blog.com/content/images/2015/Apr/ViewAttachment--1-.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I've also started working on backgrounds for scenes, mainly the Editor's Office. The biggest issue I faced with these designs is realizing NOW, post character drawing/coloring, that it's hard to design and draw backgrounds for each scene because each character already has an angle and body position. And if there are more than one or two characters in a scene (like the Editor's Office which should have 4) it becomes incredibly difficult because I have to design the scene (a very small room) so that all of the characters and their angles appear correct. I also want to talk to coding team about the screen panning in such a small room.</p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/art-team-sara-platner-post-3/<guid ispermalink="false">be061c0a-b54d-47b9-aced-22fde9f4d7a6</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Fri, 17 Apr 2015 16:24:33 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description>This week, writing team worked on writing dialogue for some of the opening scenes. I wrote a draft of the scene introducing the editor, which was reviewed by the group and will be finished as a final copy next week. Goals for next week include finishing both of the editor scenes (or finishing the first one and drafting the second scene), transferring them into .twee files, and reworking other dialogue from group members or design team. ]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/bryce-lockwood-writing-team-post-4/<guid ispermalink="false">075b08a0-7e58-47d9-91c6-bd1679c3d29b</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Fri, 17 Apr 2015 14:50:48 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description>There's still a lot of work left to do on the script. Since it's very behind compared to the rest of Steampunk Rochester, design team decided the best use of our time would be to help writing team out with some of the dialog.

<p>First of all, we all know we're using Twine. In my Interactive Narrative class we're using RenPy, but I prefer Twine by far. Twine's UI is a lot more visual, creating notecards for different parts of conversations and arrows connecting them. It's so much more intuitive than RenPy, which is basically just a very very long script. You don't know if you messed up until you try to run it, while Twine has very reactive feedback. If you try to link to a card that doesn't exist yet, it will ask if you would like to add that card.</p>

<p>We started with the first person you talk to in the game, a socialite at a high society party. Before jumping into writing we wanted to figure out the character and her personality. We went straight to the whiteboard and started mapping her out.</p>

<p><img src="http://my-ghost-blog.com/content/images/2015/Apr/IMG_8023-2.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>We knew we wanted her to be connected to Aleksei through her brother, his friend. You talk to her at the party because she's the only one you know, and you were invited because she is the hostess. We wanted the conversation with her to teach the player about the world without obvious, boring exposition of explaining everything that the character would already know. Mario was very demandant of her not being snooty, which became a very important part of her character. She's friendly and her main goal is to be liked by everybody and be popular. She's always in the know and is very outgoing and easy to talk to. She's up to date on all the current rumors, phrases, and slang.</p>

<p>We came to adore this Matty Ray, and I ended up writing most of her dialog myself. I put myself in her shoes, thinking of ways to let you get to know this character while also teaching the player. Throughout asking her questions, trading stories, and very natural feeling conversation, the player learns a lot not only about her and the world but about their own character as well.</p>

<p>We made sure to add a lot of 1920's slang and phrases into her speaking because we knew she'd be very up on all of that. Her most used word is "fabulous", which we thought fit her personality extremely well. She's in the Church of Light because it's the popular thing to do, and later on when the player learns about the Church of Light and that everybody at that part was part of it, we hope that they'll pick up on this nuance. She doesn't really know much about them, just that everybody who's anybody is participating.</p>

<p>Matty is currently my favorite character, but as of right now she's only in the intro. I can see her showing up again later in the game, but maybe not in the scope of this class. Regardless, I'm looking forward to writing more characters.</p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/design-team-does-dialog/<guid ispermalink="false">d793d60e-d592-4179-b2bc-3931834986f5</guid><category></category><category></category><category></category><category></category><creator></creator><pubdate>Fri, 17 Apr 2015 13:32:53 GMT</pubdate></item><item><title></title><description>Currently working on the emotion system.
