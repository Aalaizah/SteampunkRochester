        <section class="post-content">
            <p>I am one of the few students who continued with the class from <em>wiki to production</em>. I'm a bit more familiar with the initial world but there's a lot there and I enjoy seeing other people find/make interesting things.</p>

<p>I'm also a <strong>creative writer</strong> so I naturally gravitated to the writing team. We're been tasked with a large chunk of the game for just three people, so the going is a bit slow. But it was cool to have a lot of help and brainstorming with the rest of the production team early on and to know we can rely on them for input later.</p>

<p>So, writing team has was tasked with finishing an overall story for our primary main character, <strong>Fluffy</strong>, the Russian pseudo-Duke who fled from his homeland. His character is still a work in progress, but he's generally driven by fame and maybe a little fortune. He wants to be known for something and give people a reason not to look down on him, but rather to look up to him. With the help of the art team, we want him to be more of a high class kind of guy, and probably no nonsense. </p>

<p>So, his story is well in the works. Because we're basically building a <strong>mystery game with multiple ending</strong> options, it's difficult for use to get rolling on the overall story. <em>We've started with the different endings</em> that we want the player to have, since those are central to the game. Currently, we're organizing clues and other bits of information to see what it is we need to point us toward each ending. We're slowly figuring out what locations and people we need that are natural environments for each of those pieces to be found. Since the gameplay allows the player to pick locations in any order, there is <strong>no set chronological order</strong> to spaces, which means we need to write each scene as a contained piece that knows what other scenes the player has experienced already.</p>

<p>It is quite a challenge.</p>

<p>Design team was very adamant about getting some locations, so we worked up a list for that, which helped us figure out potential people we might meet(useful or not) and we're currently going through location by location determining what characters might give the player what info, if there is anything to find, or info to be had from a character later after talking to someone else or doing something else.</p>

<p>We really want the player to work a bit in this game. I'm a big fan of <em>MYST</em> and how much of the story has to be read and understood by the player. It doesn't explicitly tell you what you need to do to solve puzzles or why you are doing something. I also love the misleading elements in <em>MYST</em> where one brother says he is right and the other brothers says, no, he is right, and they both just sound crazy. It's the player's choice to read the library, figure out puzzles, and fix the books. And ultimately, they have to make a decision themselves where they can't be sure of the outcomes.</p>

<p>I want to infuse some of that  <strong>uncertainty and self reliance on the player</strong>. If we have documents the character picks up, the player must read those, there isn't a summary. None of that "the main character voices their inner thoughts about the object to the player." or the game taking notes for you. Ideally, our game won't just lead the player by the hand. <em>MYST</em> made an admirer out of me there. lol</p>

<p>So, right now, we have a finished summary of the big events, and are piecing together <strong>Fluffy's storyline</strong>. We'll hopefully have something ready to be turned into location/scene based scripts. Hopefully those will be started next week. And from there also, we can give the programming team a basic script to run through twine. It's a bit slower going than people would like with three people, but it is enjoyable.</p>

<p>We're also planning with the design and programming teams how the dialogue structure will work. We'll be using Twine and parsing it into Unity. The general idea is the player will have <strong>parallel branching</strong> choices, being able to pick a topic, and within that, choose how they say something or specifically what they say (tell information, be evasive, or be rude or nice). They may also be able to present some evidence to npcs, who will either have no idea or will start an action/other conversation.</p>
