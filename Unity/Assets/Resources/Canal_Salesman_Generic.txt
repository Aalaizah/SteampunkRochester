Foreman: so, good buddy, did I ever tell of the time my old partner and I scammed some suffragettes? They were working in factory and doing a thing but no one cares what it was, it was such a long time ago, maybe before they had the vote. No one cares about them anymore, I know I don't, right?

Foreman: Well, my old partner, he's the face of a generic bystander, but damn was he quick on his feet. Best grifter this side of the east coast. You'll never find a more dishonest son of a bitch. Even I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw him, but that's mostly because he was heavy. Anyways, one of them ladies needed a prosthetic pinky, so we tried to sell them a replica made of cheap copper.
