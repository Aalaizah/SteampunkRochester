Tim White: Thankfully, this man came up to me, and said he could save my dog. So he brought Gizmo and I to his home.  When we got there, he applied some home remedies, and let Gizmo drink some glowing water which he learned the healing properties of from the Church of Light. A day later, Gizmo was running around like his normal self. It was MAGIC!
