:: TheRage
Matty: Oh it's all the rage now, darling. I was actually just introduced to it! You're not just imagining, it really is glowing! It's just a natural little bit of water from the canal you add to it and there it goes, shining like the sun!

:: TheStory
Aleksei: Well I was walking down West Main Street, on my way to Hots and Potatoes for breakfast. Before I knew it, something zoomed right passed me, nearly blowing my hat off! I whipped around to see what it was, and imagine my surprise when I saw a large man skating around... on steam-powered roller skates!

:: NextBigThing
Aleksei: I'm in between stories, sadly. I'm trying to look for the next big thing, front page news! I very much enjoy my job, but small filler pieces will get me nowhere. That Pulitzer Prize is calling to me, Matty. I just have to figure out how to get there. But I will! Like we say back home, "without effort you won't pull a fish out of the pond".

There's been a lot of talk about the canal water... most nights it seems to be completely lit, as if it was full of lanterns or fireflies! We are actually planning to take a boat and go on a cruise down the canal one night; it's going to be absolutely gorgeous.
