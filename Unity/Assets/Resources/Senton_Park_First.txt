Senton: The glowing water in the canal is somehow better than normal water. We believe it was an act of God, to help us nuture our bodies in service to Him. Our wine is made with the glowing water, and we support any uses of the water.

Senton: Why, to make sure that people know we are serious about our beliefs and to make sure those of the same thought can find us easier. It's expensive work to make advertisements in all the papers now. Churches are tax exempt, however.
