:: YesMan
Aleksei: Yes, I've found you a story. It took a while to find the leads, but I finally have it.

:: Goodbye
Fluffy: Dah, I will go get story for you. Goodbye.


:: DefaultStory
Aleksei: It's kind of disappointing, but there is nothing special about that water. Apparently it just glows naturally. I don't know why the Church of Light is so obsessed with it, but there's nothing to their claims of its "magic properties."

:: DogStory
Aleksei: So, from talking to a man in a bar, I found out that the glowing water has healing properties. The man's dog was wounded, but the water healed it I’m not so sure of the effects of the water, but the members use it to heal ailments and it works! Turns out the Church of Light isn't so crazy after all. Maybe I'll become a member...

:: SentonStory
Aleksei: I found that the Church of Light leader, Mason Senton, has been manipulating the church's members for his own gain. He may have actually had something to do with it's spread in the first place, but I can't confirm that without more investigation. He used to work as a con-man, and apparently moved on to bigger fish.

Editor: That's...not very exciting. But, a story is a story. Write it up and I'll look over your draft tomorrow.


:: DogStoryEnd
Editor: ...well, I guess that's what we're printing now, not enough time to find anything better...


:: SentonStoryEnd
Editor: Hmm, was hoping for a story like that. Type it up, and I'll proof it before we send it out tomorrow.
