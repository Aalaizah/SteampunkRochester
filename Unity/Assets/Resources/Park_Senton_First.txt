Senton: The glowing water in the canal is somehow better than normal water. We believe it was an act of God, to help us nurture our bodies in service to Him. Our wine is made with the glowing water, and we support any uses of the water.

[[Contine|AnswerRecognized]]


:: AnswerRecognized
Senton: Why, to make sure that people know we are serious about our beliefs and to ensure those of the same thought can find us. It can be expensive advertising in the papers. And churches are tax exempt, which would ease a lot of the financial strain.
