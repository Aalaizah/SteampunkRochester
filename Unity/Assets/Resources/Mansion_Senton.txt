The bottle's bordered label is very plane; it simply says "Red Wine." Somethign else seems to be written on the inside, but it's hard to see through the dark bottle and dark liquid.

With enough wine poured out of it, the inside of the label can be read clearly. "Scheduled for: Thursday"

Senton: If it's not made like normal wine, I have have hardly any idea. I appreciate the daily glass; it's good for you, but I don't know. It works.

[[About your past...|AskConman]]

Senton: I am not concerned you know the truth because I am not that person anymore. Yes, yes, I'm sure it's a common story to slip from the lips of a conman, that they are a "changed" man.

:: AnswerReveal
Senton: I must admit that this church is founded by my desire to express my values. The water just happened to be a grand coincidence that helped push my church further. I'll have you know I had tried to found it years before, but it was only after the canal began glowing that providence was with me.

Senton: There is also no way to prove anything of what I did before besides that friend of mine. Whose soul and body are just as unclean as mine used to be. Tell him to stop by our gatherings some time, will you? That way he can get a real pin. *he winks and stands up*
