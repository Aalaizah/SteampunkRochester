The bottle's bordered label is very plane; it simply says "Red Wine." Somethign else seems to be written on the inside, but it's hard to see through the dark bottle and dark liquid.

Senton: Lovely color, isn't it? The water makes it an almost purple or red violet.

With enough wine poured out of it, the inside of the label can be read clearly. "Scheduled for: Thursday"

Senton: *both sit down in the study* Now, the last time we spoke, you had some interesting questions for me, about the mafia and conmen.

Aleksei: At the park, you said the glowing wine you bought was from the mafia. What can you tell me about where you get the wine? Does the mafia make it?

Aleksei: There's something off about you and your Church of Light. There's a lot of off color rumors floating around.

Senton: I do have underworld contacts. I know what I am doing. Is there anything else? I'm not sure I can tell you much. Talk to the Zicardi's or Mercurios if you want to know more. Just be discrete.

Aleksei: When I confronted him about this and his source for purified glowing water, he mentioned an old conman partner he had. He described him exactly like you.
[[Continue|RevealSenton3]]


:: ExplainPast2
Senton: Believe I caused the glowng water if you wish. I'm a protected figure in this community, good sir. Besides, even if I did do it, where do you think I got the man power? Where would anyone get the man power? Or the supplies to even tint the canal blue for one day of the year? Who's making the most money off of this? Certainly not me! What kind of conman would I be, making less money than the mafia?

[[What about the water?|AboutWater]]

Senton: Whatever you think, I have a right to privacy. And right now, the press is unwelcome in it. Find out from someone else who dumped-- made your water glow.
