Foreman: Damn. I should've known I couldn't ever match his skill. But it sure is sad that I can't even make a simple replica pin. How does he do it? What do I have to do to reach his level?

Foreman: My old partner. Best grifter this side of the east coast. You'll never find a more dishonest son of a bitch. Even I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw him, but that's mostly because he was really fat. But he could forge goods with the best of them, which is why he and I made the best team, despite him being a consumate liar.
