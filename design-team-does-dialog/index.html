            <p>There's still a lot of work left to do on the script. Since it's very behind compared to the rest of Steampunk Rochester, design team decided the best use of our time would be to help writing team out with some of the dialog.</p>

<p>First of all, we all know we're using Twine. In my Interactive Narrative class we're using RenPy, but I prefer Twine by far. Twine's UI is a lot more visual, creating notecards for different parts of conversations and arrows connecting them. It's so much more intuitive than RenPy, which is basically just a very very long script. You don't know if you messed up until you try to run it, while Twine has very reactive feedback. If you try to link to a card that doesn't exist yet, it will ask if you would like to add that card.</p>

<p>We started with the first person you talk to in the game, a socialite at a high society party. Before jumping into writing we wanted to figure out the character and her personality. We went straight to the whiteboard and started mapping her out.</p>

<p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:2368/content/images/2015/Apr/IMG_8023-2.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>We knew we wanted her to be connected to Aleksei through her brother, his friend. You talk to her at the party because she's the only one you know, and you were invited because she is the hostess. We wanted the conversation with her to teach the player about the world without obvious, boring exposition of explaining everything that the character would already know. Mario was very demandant of her not being snooty, which became a very important part of her character. She's friendly and her main goal is to be liked by everybody and be popular. She's always in the know and is very outgoing and easy to talk to. She's up to date on all the current rumors, phrases, and slang.</p>

<p>We came to adore this Matty Ray, and I ended up writing most of her dialog myself. I put myself in her shoes, thinking of ways to let you get to know this character while also teaching the player. Throughout asking her questions, trading stories, and very natural feeling conversation, the player learns a lot not only about her and the world but about their own character as well.</p>

<p>We made sure to add a lot of 1920's slang and phrases into her speaking because we knew she'd be very up on all of that. Her most used word is "fabulous", which we thought fit her personality extremely well. She's in the Church of Light because it's the popular thing to do, and later on when the player learns about the Church of Light and that everybody at that part was part of it, we hope that they'll pick up on this nuance. She doesn't really know much about them, just that everybody who's anybody is participating.</p>

<p>Matty is currently my favorite character, but as of right now she's only in the intro. I can see her showing up again later in the game, but maybe not in the scope of this class. Regardless, I'm looking forward to writing more characters.</p>
