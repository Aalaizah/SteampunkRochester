            <p>Brooke Milan, Writing Team <br>
Week 9</p>

<p>So this week, writing team finished up the overall plot summary. This helps us all see the big picture and make sure we're all on the same page. I spent most of my time trying to figure out what the suffragists are doing as a faction, so I suggested that for them, we focus less on the group, and more on a few "extremists" within them. This would give us some defined characters to talk to (if we were doing that side of the story, since our Russian won't talk to them much) and I also thought it would be a good way to tie in the industrial side of Rochester in the 1920s. Our more militant suffragists work at a factory, where they may or may not have been dumping some chemical(or otherwise) waste into the river. Or at least, then knew what was going on...</p>

<p>I am playing with suggesting the idea of making sure we have a narrow character list. Not too narrow that everyone in the story is "involved" in the McGuffin, but narrow as in, characters from all three sections of the story (where each journalist is focused) are connected between all three. For example, our Russian might see and being able to have cheerful conversation with a suffragist that our woman journalist is grilling for details about these rumors. Of course, that's the dream if we could finish this. Right now, most of these people will jut have one job, but ideally, we would repurpose them in ways that flesh them out as people.</p>

<p>We've just finished our heavy brainstorming phrase and hopefully we will get this mystery on the road. Even starting backward and building from there, clues are hard. I've done a lot of writing, but never a mystery so it's going to be a lot of guess and check for how much/how little/is this clue even in the right place.</p>

<p>We also named(not final) our three main characters Fluffy, Suffy, and Scruffy, so that they can be identified by the average person. Aleksei is our Russian Duke, Sophie is our American woman cutting it in the man's world of journalism, and Kieran is our gruff but good Irish immigrant Great War veteran turned photographer. </p>

<p>Next week, we will start working with Twine to make our dialogue branches and I am really excited for this. In prepping for it, I am building a character connection chart to see where each of our characters, major and minor, stand, their relationships to all the other characters, their motivations, and just other blurbs that make them them. I want to build it in Twine for Twine's nifty tree structure, but it's hard to show off that way, so I am using Excel.</p>

<p>Meet our main characters so far(minus art) <br>
1.       Aleksei <br>
