            <p>Being on design team is always interesting. We deal with all the teams in order to make sure nobody strays from the vision, and that everybody is on the same page. But simply dealing with each other is always interesting as well. We're constantly trying to evolve what we're doing and give it more depth.</p>

<p>Since our first paper prototype was a success and showed proof of concept mechanic-wise, we decided that the next step was to make a prototype from the game's actual story. The trouble here is that we have no script yet, so we're not sure how to move on. We've made the locations, but what next? We've been talking to writing team a lot working on characters and trying to think of evidence and figure out how the multiple endings will work, and I feel like that might be the most important use of our time.</p>

<p>Writing team has been posed with a challenge and I think that if we helped them out we could move a lot faster. We need to get a script done, but they're not done with the storyline yet so cannot move on. If design team can help out with that, then they can get a script done and we can do our paper prototype and they can get it into the game. That's the new goal.</p>
